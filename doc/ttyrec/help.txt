# This is a tutorial of toomanyfiles
# We are going to create an example subdirectory to learn it's use
toomanyfiles --create_example

# We are going to see the 10 last files, for example
ls -la example| tail -n 10

# We can see files with the temporal pattern YYYYmmdd HHMM
# We use to find this files in automatic backups, logs, ...
# Our hard disk it's almost full, so we want to keep some of them
# We want to keep the last 5 files because they are too recent
# We want to keep the first file of each month from the rest of the files
# until a max number the files of 15.

# We enter in the example directory
cd example

# We make a simulation
toomanyfiles --too_young_to_delete 5 --max_files_to_store 15 --pattern "%Y%m%d %H%M" --pretend

#We can analyze the result with the output
# We ike the result, so we can delete the files

toomanyfiles --too_young_to_delete 5 --max_files_to_store 15 --pattern "%Y%m%d %H%M" --remove

# We list the files remaining
ls -la example

# That's all
